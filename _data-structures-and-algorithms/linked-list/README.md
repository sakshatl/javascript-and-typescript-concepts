## Linked List

### Linked lists are compared to arrays:

- don't have indices
- they do not occupy contiguous space in the memory, they can be all over

Linked lists have a `HEAD` that points to the first item and a `TAIL` that points to the last item.
Each item in the list points to the next and the last item points to `NULL`
