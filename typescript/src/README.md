## Variables in TypeScript

## Static type checking

Static type checking is the process of verifying the type safety of a program based on analysis of a program's source code. A language is statically-typed if the type of a variable is known at compile time instead of at runtime. Example: Java and C#

Based upon the type of a variable, TypeScript also provides accurate intellisense.
