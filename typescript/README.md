## TypeScript Concepts

TypeScript is a "typed" superset of JavaScript. It is a open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft.

## Why TypeScript

1. TypeScript is just extended JavaScript. It can compile down to plain JavaScript
2. Optional Static Typing and Type Inference: JavaScript is dynamically typed. TypeScript on the other hand adds types to JavaScript code. So errors can be identfied at the compilation step. Specifying the type is optional.
3. Rapid growth and use. There is going to be a lot of TypeScript in the world of web

## Installing TypeScript on your machine

1. Install Node
2. `npm install -g typescript`
3. Check `tsc --version` to check for the version installed on your machine
